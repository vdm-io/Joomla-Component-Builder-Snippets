    "description": "Dropdowns are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and more. They\u2019re made interactive with the included Bootstrap dropdown JavaScript plugin. They\u2019re toggled by clicking, not by hovering; this is an intentional design decision.\r\n\r\nDropdowns are built on a third party library, Popper.js, which provides dynamic positioning and viewport detection. Be sure to include popper.min.js before Bootstrap\u2019s JavaScript or use bootstrap.bundle.min.js \/ bootstrap.bundle.js which contains Popper.js.",
    "usage": "Any single .btn can be turned into a dropdown toggle with some markup changes. Here\u2019s how you can put them to work with either  elements.",
