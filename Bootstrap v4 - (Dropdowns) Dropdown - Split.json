    "description": "Dropdowns are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and more. They\u2019re made interactive with the included Bootstrap dropdown JavaScript plugin. They\u2019re toggled by clicking, not by hovering; this is an intentional design decision.\r\n\r\nDropdowns are built on a third party library, Popper.js, which provides dynamic positioning and viewport detection. Be sure to include popper.min.js before Bootstrap\u2019s JavaScript or use bootstrap.bundle.min.js \/ bootstrap.bundle.js which contains Popper.js.",
    "usage": "Similarly, create split button dropdowns with virtually the same markup as single button dropdowns, but with the addition of .dropdown-toggle-split for proper spacing around the dropdown caret.\r\n\r\nWe use this extra class to reduce the horizontal padding on either side of the caret by 25% and remove the margin-left that\u2019s added for regular button dropdowns. Those extra changes keep the caret centered in the split button and provide a more appropriately sized hit area next to the main button.",
