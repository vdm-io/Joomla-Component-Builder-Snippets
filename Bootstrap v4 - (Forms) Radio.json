    "usage": "Default checkboxes and radios are improved upon with the help of .form-check, a single class for both input types that improves the layout and behavior of their HTML elements. Checkboxes are for selecting one or several options in a list, while radios are for selecting one option from many.\r\n\r\nDisabled checkboxes and radios are supported, but to provide a not-allowed cursor on hover of the parent , you\u2019ll need to add the .disabled class to the parent .form-check. The disabled class will also lighten the text color to help indicate the input\u2019s state.",
    "snippet": "<div class=\"form-check\">\r\n  <label class=\"form-check-label\">\r\n    <input class=\"form-check-input\" type=\"radio\" name=\"exampleRadios\" id=\"exampleRadios1\" value=\"option1\" checked=\"\">\r\n    Option one is this and that\u2014be sure to include why it's great\r\n  <\/label>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"form-check\">\r\n  <label class=\"form-check-label\">\r\n    <input class=\"form-check-input\" type=\"radio\" name=\"exampleRadios\" id=\"exampleRadios3\" value=\"option2\">\r\n    Option two can be something else and selecting it will deselect option one\r\n  <\/label>\r\n<\/div>",
