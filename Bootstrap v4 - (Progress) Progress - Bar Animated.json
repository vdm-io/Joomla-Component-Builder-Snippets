    "description": "Progress components are built with two HTML elements, some CSS to set the width, and a few attributes. We don\u2019t use the HTML5  element, ensuring you can stack progress bars, animate them, and place text labels over them.\r\n\r\n    We use the .progress as a wrapper to indicate the max value of the progress bar.\r\n    We use the inner .progress-bar to indicate the progress so far.\r\n    The .progress-bar requires an inline style, utility class, or custom CSS to set their width.\r\n    The .progress-bar also requires some role and aria attributes to make it accessible.\r\n",
    "usage": "The striped gradient can also be animated. Add .progress-bar-animated to .progress-bar to animate the stripes right to left via CSS3 animations.\r\n\r\nAnimated progress bars don\u2019t work in Opera 12\u2014as they don\u2019t support CSS3 animations.\r\n",
