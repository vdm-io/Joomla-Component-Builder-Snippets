    "usage": "The display property accepts a handful of values and we support many of them with utility classes. We purposefully don\u2019t provide every value as a utility, so here\u2019s what we support:\r\n\r\n    .d-none\r\n    .d-inline\r\n    .d-inline-block\r\n    .d-block\r\n    .d-table\r\n    .d-table-cell\r\n    .d-flex\r\n    .d-inline-flex\r\n\r\nPut them to use by applying any of the classes to an element of your choice. For example, here\u2019s how you could use the inline, block, or inline-block utilities (the same applies to the other classes).\r\n",
