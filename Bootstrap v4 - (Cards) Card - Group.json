    "description": "A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.",
    "usage": "Use card groups to render cards as a single, attached element with equal width and height columns. Card groups use display: flex; to achieve their uniform sizing.",
